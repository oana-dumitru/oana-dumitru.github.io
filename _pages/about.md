excerpt: Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida and I am studying past sea level and climate changes across glacial-interglacial timescales. My work primarily revolves around leveraging fossil corals and cave deposits as valuable climate and sea-level proxies. To establish accurate timelines for these geological materials, I use geochronological methods, such as U-Th and U-Pb dating. My goal is to contribute to more precise projections for sea-level changes in the future, which is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by ongoing climate change.
